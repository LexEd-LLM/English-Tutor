It brings cultures from all over the world to one location!\nMai: Yes, it's a way to learn about cultural diversity, particularly by tasting food from different countries.\nLinda: I'd really love to try Korean kimchi or traditional Japanese sushi. Japanese cuisine is world-famous, as well as very healthy!\nMai: Can you show us around, Nam?\nNam: Sure. Let's go to the Korean booth to try some kimchi and spicy rice cakes, called tteokbokki. I also heard that a famous K-pop group will be at their booth.\nLinda: That'll be amazing! I might meet my favourite group there and get their autographs.\nMai: Well, I'm not really interested in K-pop. Can we first go to the British booth? I'd love to try some fish and chips.\nNam: The British booth is on the corner. They serve delicious British dishes and sell souvenirs of famous tourist attractions in Britain.\nLinda: But where's the Vietnamese booth?\nNam: I can see it on the map. It's an open booth and it looks huge! Visitors can play Vietnamese traditional games such as tug of war and bamboo dancing.\nLinda: They all sound fun. I'll try to join all of them if I can.\nNam: And we can also have spring rolls and bun cha - grilled pork meatballs with noodles, which is probably Ha Noi's most popular dish.\nLinda: I suggest that we go to the Vietnamese booth first. I love Vietnamese spring rolls and would like to try bun cha.\nMai: Great. That's a nice idea."

        "content": "The effects of globalisation on cultural diversity\nAs a result of globalisation, the world is becoming more and more connected. This has changed people's way of life, beliefs, art and customs, or their culture, in many respects. Although people's experiences around the world have become very similar, globalisation has also encouraged cultural diversity. Below are some examples.\nA.\nFast food chains and international restaurants have become popular, offering a wide range of dishes and more food choices to local people. For example, here in Viet Nam, we can enjoy Italian pizza or Japanese sushi, in addition to our traditional food. Moreover, some international dishes use local ingredients, which make them unique and more suitable to local tastes. On the other hand, Vietnamese specialties, such as pho and banh mi, are also gaining popularity worldwide.\nB.\nThanks to globalisation, people can quickly discover new music from all over the world. People nowadays enjoy listening to music from different countries and cultures, and in different languages. For example, American teens are captivated by K-pop music and dance. There are also many music festivals around the globe that bring artists and music fans together. In today's connected world, it is very common for musicians across the world to work on music projects and share ideas together.\nC.\nGlobalisation has also impacted fashion by opening it up to a variety of styles and influences from around the world. Cross-cultural styles that blend both traditional and modern elements are on the rise. This presents opportunities for fashion designers to be creative and reflect the cultural richness of the world. It is now easier for people to keep up with fashion trends from different cultures and regions, and express their identities in new and exciting ways.\nIn conclusion, globalisation has helped strengthen cultural diversity in the world and made people appreciate different cultures and lifestyles."

        "content": "Culture SHOCK\nCulture shock refers to feelings of confusion or anxiety that people may have when experiencing a new and different culture. Culture shock can be caused by language barriers, unfamiliar lifestyles, different climate, or strange food. For example, visitors to the US find it hard to get used to the local tipping culture. By contrast, tipping in Japan can be considered rude and even insulting in many situations.\nThe best way to overcome culture shock is to start learning about the new culture before moving there. You should try to focus on the positive aspects of your new experiences and keep an open mind. Learning about cultural diversity helps understand different ways of thinking about the world, gain new knowledge and experiences, and promote personal growth.\nResearch says that almost two-thirds to three-quarters of the world drive on the right, while only one-third to a quarter of the world drive on the left including the UK and Australia. Or you may find out that things that you're used to are banned in another country. In Singapore, for example, the sale of chewing gum is illegal and Singaporeans take this law very seriously. So always remember that culture shock is not a bad experience, but the beginning of an exciting learning journey to cultural diversity."

We both use chopsticks; however, while we use wood or bamboo chopsticks, South Koreans eat with metal chopsticks. Street food is a big part of both cultures. We both worship ancestors, celebrate Lunar New Year, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Buddha's Birthday. Both nations also have their traditional clothing.\n*   **Differences**:\n    *   Koreans like spicy food while not all Vietnamese eat spicy dishes (except people from some provinces in the Middle or South Viet Nam).\n    *   Music: Traditional Vietnamese music is mainly used for religious activities, in daily life, and in traditional festivals. There are many music forms due to Viet Nam's numerous ethnic groups. These music forms include royal court music, dilettante music, folk music, cheo, quan ho, chau van, etc. Traditional Korean music is typically classified into several types: the ‘legitimate music’ (called jeongak or jeongga) enjoyed by the royalty and aristocrats of Joseon; folk music (court music and dance) performed for the King at celebratory state events; music and dance connected with shamanic and Buddhist traditions and poetic songs beloved of the educated elite.\n    *   Traditional clothing: Korean women wear hanbok while Vietnamese women wear ao tu than, or ao dai."

I'm going to talk to some of them. Hi, Minh, what are you doing?\nMinh: I'm helping my classmates create a Halloween haunted house.\nInterviewer: Really? I didn't know you celebrated Halloween in Viet Nam.\nMinh: Actually, it's an annual event at my school, and it's very popular among my classmates. Do you like taking part in Halloween parties?\nInterviewer: Yes, it's great fun! But I'm more interested in its origin. Halloween is believed to originate from an ancient festival in Ireland. It marked the beginning of the Celtic new year.\nInterviewer: Wow! You know so much about Halloween. Thank you. Now, let's interview another student. Hi, Mai, are you going to any Halloween parties today?\nMai: Not really. Wearing scary costumes is very childish. I also find the Halloween custom of trick or treating a bit childish.\nInterviewer: So what do you think about celebrating Halloween in Viet Nam?\nMai: It's a waste of time. Why should we celebrate it here when other countries don't celebrate Tet or other Vietnamese festivals?\nInterviewer: You have a point, but Halloween is popular in Asia. There are more international festivals celebrated in Viet Nam now. Do you think they have any negative impacts on your culture?\nMai: Not really. Many people worry that our culture will be ruined by international festivals, but they needn't worry too much. Our traditional festivals haven't lost their appeal.\nInterviewer: That's interesting. Thanks for sharing."

        "content": "Suggested answer:\nShould we celebrate world festivals?\nNowadays, more and more young Vietnamese people celebrate festivals such as Christmas and Halloween. Some people think there is nothing wrong with this while others are worried about the influence of foreign cultures. In my opinion, celebrating world festivals has more positive than negative impact on young Vietnamese.\nFirstly, festivals are a great way to understand a nation's culture. Taking part in celebrations can help young people learn more about other people's traditions and customs. For example, Christmas is a typical holiday in many foreign countries, so when joining the festivities, young people can learn about its origin and history, the tradition of decorating one's home and getting presents for family and close friends, and putting them under the Christmas tree.\nSecondly, festivals are special events that help bring fun, happiness, and joy to young people's lives. They give an opportunity for young people to relax and spend enjoyable time with their friends and family. People can enjoy the festive spirit by watching performances, dressing up, and eating festive food.\nFinally, it cannot be denied that world festivals also encourage extracurricular activities at schools. Organising special events every year, such as Halloween parties or Christmas fairs, encourages students to discover interesting things about the festivals, socialise with friends from other cultures, or create their own performances.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that celebrating world festivals in Viet Nam does more good than harm to young people. They can have fun, broaden their cultural knowledge, and enjoy their school life more."
