Who is she?\nNam: She was born in Hue in 1942. She studied medicine in Ha Noi, and volunteered to join the army at the age of 24, working as a surgeon during the resistance war against the US.\nMark: That’s when she started her diary, isn’t it?\nNam: Yes. She wrote her diary while she was working in a field hospital in Quang Ngai Province. The diary contains personal accounts of her experiences during the war, and shows her love for her family and country.\nMark: Wow! It sounds interesting. Is she still alive?\nNam: Unfortunately, she was killed by the enemy while she was doing her duty in the jungle in Quang Ngai Province. She was only 27 then. \nMark: Oh, that’s really sad. But how did people find her diary?\nNam: An American soldier found it and saved it from being burnt. Then more than 30 years after Tram’s death, a copy was returned to her mother.

        "content": "STEVE JOBS’ LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS\nA.\nSteven Paul Jobs was born on 24 February, 1955 in San Francisco, USA. His biological parents were not married and gave him up for adoption. He was **adopted** by Clara and Paul Jobs. In 1971, Jobs met Steve Wozniak, who was five years older than him, but they bonded over their love of electronics. After high school, Jobs attended Reed College in Oregon, but found the classes boring and **dropped out** after six months.\nB.\nWhen Jobs was 21, he and Wozniak started Apple Computers in Jobs’ family garage with money they got by selling Jobs’ van and Wozniak’s scientific calculator. By making computers smaller, cheaper, and accessible to everyday users, their company became a huge success and sales quickly increased.\nAlthough Jobs left Apple in 1985, he returned to his post in 1997 when the company needed new ideas. He helped invent new products such as the iMac, the iBook for students, the iPod music player, and iTunes music software. In 2007, he introduced the touch-screen iPhone which changed the way phones were used. Apple products were not only designed to be cutting-edge technology, but also to be stylish and easy to use.\nIn addition, Jobs contributed to computer animation. In 1986, he bought a small company, which later became Pixar Animation Studios. It produced the first full-length computer-animated film *Toy Story*, followed by other blockbusters.\nC.\nIn 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic **cancer**. He fought the disease for several years, and stopped working in August, 2011. Two months later, he **passed away**. He had four children, three with his wife of 20 years and one from a previous relationship. On an Apple web page, a statement reads, ‘Apple has lost a visionary and creative **genius**, and the world has lost an amazing human being.\n1. adopted\nA. given birth to\nB. taken by another family as their own child\n2. dropped out\nA. continued to study\nB. left school/college before completing your studies\n3. cancer\nA. a serious disease\nB. a dangerous animal\n4. passed away\nA. died\nB. went past something\n5. genius\nA. a very intelligent person\nB. an ordinary person’"

        "content": "Walt Disney was one of the most admired people in the film industry. Many of the films created by his company are very popular with both children and adults.\nHowever, success did not come early for Disney. When he set up his own film company, it was not very profitable. So Disney chose to move to Hollywood to start a new career.\nThere, he developed a character based on a pet mouse he once had, under the name of Mickey Mouse. He even gave the mouse his own voice. Soon, Mickey Mouse became the world’s most popular cartoon character and Disney was very popular worldwide.\nBut Disney did not stop there. He went on to produce his first feature-length animated film *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*. The film became a huge success, earning more than 400 million dollars since its release and eight Oscars, the top award in the film industry. Throughout his career, Disney won or received 26 Oscars – a record in history.\nBesides making films, Disney was also the creator of the first Disneyland theme park which opened in 1955. Nowadays, there are 12 Disney parks around the world where people can meet Disney cartoon characters and see live shows of their magical stories.\nAfter his death, The Walt Disney Studios continued to make high-quality live-action and animated films, such as *The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast,* and *The Lion King*. His films continue to inspire both adults and children to follow their dreams.\nExtension: Ask some additional questions to check Ss’ comprehension of other details in the listening text, e.g. *Who are his films popular with?* (both children and adults) *How much money did his first film company make?* (Not much, it was not very profitable.)."
